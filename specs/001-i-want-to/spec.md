   ‚Üí Resolved: 5MB file size limit
   ‚Üí Resolved: No content moderation in MVP
   ‚Üí Resolved: Anonymous usage only
   ‚Üí Resolved: No data retention required
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: Upload photo ‚Üí Receive humorous roast
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Photo upload, roast generation, display results
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Photo uploads, roast content
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All clarifications resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user visits the web app wanting entertainment and humor. They upload a photo (of themselves, friends, objects, etc.) and receive a witty, humorous "roast" or comedic commentary about the photo. The roast should be funny but not offensive or harmful.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a photo on their device, **When** they upload it to the web app, **Then** the system generates and displays a humorous roast of the photo
2. **Given** a user uploads an appropriate photo, **When** the roast is generated, **Then** the roast text is entertaining and family-friendly
3. **Given** a user wants to try again, **When** they upload a different photo, **Then** they receive a new, unique roast

### Edge Cases
- How does system handle corrupted or invalid image files?
- What happens when roast generation fails or times out (exceeds 10 seconds)?
- How does system respond to files larger than 5MB?
- What happens when OpenAI service is unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload photos from their device
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate humorous, family-friendly roast text based on uploaded photos using OpenAI
- **FR-003**: System MUST display the generated roast text to the user
- **FR-004**: System MUST support common image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle photo uploads up to 5MB in size
- **FR-006**: System MUST respond with generated roast within 10 seconds of photo upload
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow anonymous usage without requiring user accounts
- **FR-008**: System MUST delete uploaded photos immediately after roast generation (no data retention)
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle upload failures gracefully with appropriate error messages
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate image file format and size before processing

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Photo Upload**: User-submitted image file with metadata (upload timestamp, file size, format) - deleted immediately after processing
- **Roast Content**: Generated humorous text commentary created by OpenAI based on photo analysis
