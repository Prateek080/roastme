## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Frontend-only JavaScript application with OpenAI integration
   → Extract: ES2020+, Jest testing, static hosting deployment
2. Load optional design documents ✓:
   → data-model.md: PhotoFile, RoastResponse entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: OpenAI integration contract → API client tests
   → research.md: Technical decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category ✓:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, build system, PWA, security (T001-T009)
   → Tests: unit tests, integration tests, a11y, performance, mobile (T010-T023)
   → Core: services, components, utilities with production features (T024-T038)
   → Production: security, caching, analytics, offline support (T039-T050)
   → Deployment: build pipeline, CI/CD, monitoring, documentation (T051-T060)
4. Apply task rules ✓:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...) ✓
6. Generate dependency graph ✓
7. Create parallel execution examples ✓
8. Validate task completeness ✓:
   → All contracts have tests ✓
   → All entities have models ✓
   → All components implemented ✓
   → Security and privacy addressed ✓
   → Production deployment ready ✓
   → Accessibility and mobile support ✓
   → Performance monitoring included ✓
9. Return: SUCCESS (production-ready tasks ready for execution)
